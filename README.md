# Iris-Dataset
This visualization provides step-by-step instructions for creating various plots using Python's Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries. Here's a summary of the tasks covered:

General Statistics Plot:

A pair plot is generated to visualize relationships between features in the Iris dataset, with different species colored differently.
Pie Plot for Species Frequency:

A pie chart is created to display the frequency distribution of Iris species.
Scatter Plot for Sepal Dimensions:

A scatter plot of sepal length vs. sepal width is plotted, showing relationships between these features for different Iris species.
Pairwise Distribution of Sepal and Petal Dimensions:

A matrix of scatter plots and histograms is created to visualize pairwise relationships between sepal and petal dimensions across species.
Joint Plot:

A joint plot visualizes the relationship between sepal length and width, along with individual distributions for each feature.
KDE Plot for Setosa's Sepal Dimensions:

A Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) plot is generated for the sepal length and width of the Setosa species.
KDE Plot for Setosa's Petal Dimensions:

Another KDE plot is generated for petal length and width in the Setosa species.
